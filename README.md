## üìä Power BI Sales Dashboard 

### **1. Objective**

The primary objective of this Power BI project is to develop an interactive and insightful sales dashboard using real-world business data. The goal is to transform raw sales data into visual, decision-support tools that help identify key business metrics such as total sales, profit margins, regional performance, category-wise contributions, and customer segments. The dashboard aims to enable stakeholders to make informed business decisions through clear, interactive, and concise visualizations.

---

### **2. Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is from the widely referenced file **‚ÄúPavan Lalwani Sales Report.xlsx‚Äù**, specifically the **‚ÄòOrders‚Äô** sheet. It contains transactional sales data, including:

* Order ID
* Order Date & Ship Date
* Customer Name & Segment
* Product Category & Sub-Category
* Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit
* Region & Ship Mode

This structured dataset simulates real-world e-commerce or retail sales operations, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis and business intelligence reporting.

### **3. Key Insights**

From the analysis and dashboard visualizations, the following key insights were derived:

* **Top-performing segments and regions** were identified, revealing which markets drive the most revenue.
* **Product categories and sub-categories** with high profit margins and low sales volume were discovered, suggesting pricing or promotion strategies.
* Time-based trends showed **seasonal peaks in sales**, aiding forecasting.
* **Profitability analysis** by discount revealed the impact of discounts on overall profit.
* Key **customer segments and top customers** were identified for retention strategies.

---

### **4. Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling, transformation (Power Query), and dashboard design.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated fields and measures like Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Ratio.
* **Microsoft Excel**: As the source of the dataset.
* **GitHub**: For version control and project showcase.
* **Data Visualization Best Practices**: Color coding, slicers, tooltips, and bookmarks for enhanced interactivity.

### **5. Business Problem Statement**

The company wants to optimize its sales and profitability by better understanding its sales data. However, decision-makers lack access to interactive reports that clearly identify high-performing products, regions, or customer segments. The problem lies in the raw, unaggregated data that doesn‚Äôt support visual interpretation. This project solves that by creating a clean, dynamic dashboard.

---

### **6. Steps to Develop the Dashboard**

1. **Import Data**: Load the Excel file into Power BI Desktop.
2. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Remove nulls and duplicates.
   * Format date columns and assign correct data types.
3. **Data Modeling**:

   * Build relationships (if using multiple tables).
   * Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (e.g., `Total Profit`, `Profit %`, `Sales Trend`).
4. **Visual Design**:

   * Add cards for KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Orders, Quantity.
   * Use bar/column charts for regional and category analysis.
   * Line chart for time-series analysis.
   * Pie chart or donut for customer segment distribution.
   * Slicers for filters (Region, Category, Date, etc.).
5. **Formatting**:

   * Use consistent colors, labels, titles, and tooltips.
   * Enable interaction settings to guide user flow.
6. **Publish/Export**:

   * Save `.pbix` file.
   * Export static reports or publish to Power BI Service if needed.

### **7. Applicability**

This dashboard can be used by:

* **Sales Managers** to track performance.
* **Marketing Teams** to identify promotion targets.
* **Executives** for high-level overview and decision-making.
* **Operations Teams** for logistical optimization.

It also serves as an excellent template for e-commerce and retail analytics in real-world use cases.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the ability to take raw business data and convert it into a clear, interactive, and actionable dashboard using Power BI. It highlights essential data analytics skills such as data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculation, and visual storytelling. By showcasing this dashboard, I aim to demonstrate both technical proficiency in Power BI and the ability to derive insights that support business strategy and operational decisions.
